"# Speech-emotion-recognition-model" 
This is the project, I have did during my 3 months internship at Zidio development.


This project includes basic steps of Data Science lifecycle -- 
    1> Data collection
    2> Data loading
    3> Data cleaning
    4> Data visualization
    5> Data transformation
    6> Data modeling
    7> Performance measurement

There are two main things are there in the code :
    1> 'mfcc' function -- This function helps to extract the information.
    2> LSTM Neural network -- This model uses a LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory), which is going to do all calculations.
